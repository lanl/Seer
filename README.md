Seer is a lightweight insitu wrapper library adding insitu capabilities to simulations.


## Requirements

* CMake 3.10 or above
* C++ 11
* MPI 3
* Mochi
* Paraview Catalyst


## Environment Setup

* This project uses [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Once Spack is installed, modify (or create) packages.yaml to contain the following:

~~~bash
packages:
    libfabric:
        variants: fabrics=tcp,rxm
~~~

* Setting up packages

~~~bash
spack install openmpi

# Mochi
git clone https://github.com/mochi-hpc/mochi-spack-packages
spack repo add mochi-spack-packages
spack install mochi-margo
spack install mochi-sdskv+leveldb
spack install py-mochi-sdskv

# To install Jupyter notebook (for the client)
#   load the python associated with the mochi python
spack load -r py-sdskv  

#   install jupyter for that python
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
python -m pip install jupyter

# ParaView
spack install paraview@5.7.0 +osmesa +python3 ^hwloc@1.9

# VTK (Optional for testing)
spack install vtk #(spack install vtk ^hdf5+hl+mpi to bypass error)

# Papi (usually already on the server and doesn't need install)
spack install papi
~~~


## Building the sim

The following environment needs to be activated as follows:

~~~bash
# load whatever modules the sim needs

# load Seer insitu stuff as follows
spack load -r margo
spack load -r sdskeyval

spack load paraview@5.7.0
spack load mesa #needed for ParaView without X

cd src
mkdir build

cd build
ccmake ..
~~~


## Running

There are three parts of running the insitu package

1. launch the mochi server
2. run the sim
3. run the client


### 1. Run the Mochi Server (done on server, usually in a batch script)

~~~bash
# Load the modules
spack load -r margo
spack load -r sdskeyval

# Distributed memory
# skv-server-daemon ofi+tcp://<path of server>:<port of server> <name of db>:ldb &
sdskv-server-daemon ofi+tcp://192.168.101.186:1234 foo_test1:ldb &

# Shared memory (testing purposes)
sdskv-server-daemon na+sm foo:ldb -f address &
~~~


### 2. Run the Sim (usually batch script)

~~~bash
# load whatever modules the sim needs

# load Seer insitu stuff as follows 
spack load -r margo
spack load -r sdskeyval

spack load paraview@5.7.0
spack load mesa #needed for ParaView without X


# Run the sim

# Distributed memory
# mpirun -np 4 <sim_name> --insitu <input file>
mpirun -np 4 demoApps/miniAppStructured --insitu ../inputs/input-test.json  

# Shared memory (testing purposes
demoApps/testMPI na+sm://9923/0 1 foo 10  
~~~

### 3. Run the client

#### Remote (On Server)

Get a compute node on the server

~~~bash
# Load the modules
spack load -r py-sdskv

# only needed first time
jupyter-notebook password

# Launch jupyter notebook on the server
# jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=<port_number> --ip=0.0.0.0
jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=8897 --ip=0.0.0.0

~~~

#### Local (client)

~~~bash
# Tunnel to the server
#   ssh -N -f -L <port_number>:<host_name>:<port_number> username@cluster 
ssh -N -f -L 8897:cn37:8897 pascalgrosset@darwin-fe
~~~

In the browser:

~~~bash
# http://localhost:<port_number>
http://localhost:8897
~~~

# Note

## Environment setup

Scripts for setting up the environment different platforms are located in the evn folder:

* <machine_name>_sim.sh
* <machine_name>_mochiServer.sh
* <machine_name>_jupyter.sh

Scripts for launching sims are located in the script folder:

* miniAppStruc_darwin.sh
* runBatch__256_16_16_scaling_mochi.sh
* runBatch__64_8_8_glaton_mochi.sh


## No papi counters found

* Check if papi events are around using: papi_avail | more
* Turn them on (if disabled) using: sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
