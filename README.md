# Seer

Seer is a lightweight insitu wrapper library adding insitu capabilities to simulations.


## Requirements

* CMake 3.10 or above
* C++ 11
* MPI 3
* Mochi

Note: gcc/6.4.0 is recommended (gcc/7*, gcc/8*, gcc/9* caused errors when installing Mochi packages ... :( )


## Environment/Packages Setup (first time only)

This project uses [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Once Spack is installed,
~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
~~~
modify (or create) packages.yaml in the ~/.spack folder so that it contains the following:


~~~bash
packages:
    libfabric:
        variants: fabrics=tcp,rxm
~~~

* Setting up packages

~~~bash
# Mochi
git clone https://github.com/mochi-hpc/mochi-spack-packages
spack repo add mochi-spack-packages
spack install mochi-margo ^libfabric@1.11.0     # there appears to be a bug in the latest libfrabic 1.13.0
spack install mochi-sdskv+leveldb ^libfabric@1.11.0
spack install py-mochi-sdskv ^libfabric@1.11.0
spack install papi
~~~

Will take about two hours or so ...

For simplicity, create an bash file (e.g. evn.sh) which contains the following, which will be sourced anytime the modules are needed.
~~~bash
module load cmake
spack load -r mochi-margo
spack load -r mochi-sdskv+leveldb
spack load -r py-mochi-sdskv
spack load -r papi
~~~


## Building the sim

The following environment needs to be activated as follows:

~~~bash
# load Seer insitu stuff as follows
module load cmake
spack load -r mochi-margo
spack load -r mochi-sdskv+leveldb
spack load -r py-mochi-sdskv
spack load -r papi
~~~

or

~~~ bash
source evn/env_darwin_new.sh
~~~


Build the code:

~~~ bash
cd src
mkdir build

cd build
ccmake ..
~~~


## Running

There are three parts of running the insitu package

1. launch the mochi server
2. run the sim
3. run the client


### 1. Run the Mochi Server (done on server, usually in a batch script)
Find the ipaddress of the node using $ifconfig$ and add that to the address field in inputs/input-test.json.
That ipaddress will also be used to launch the mochi server.


~~~bash
# Load the modules (if not previously loaded)
spack load -r mochi-margo
spack load -r mochi-sdskv+leveldb
# or
source evn/env_darwin_new.sh

# Distributed memory
# sdskv-server-daemon ofi+tcp://<path of server>:<port of server> <name of db>:ldb &
sdskv-server-daemon ofi+tcp://192.168.101.180:1234 foo_test2:ldb &


# Shared memory (testing purposes only)
sdskv-server-daemon na+sm foo_test1:ldb -f address &
~~~


### 2. Run the Sim (usually batch script)

~~~bash
# load whatever modules the sim needs (if not previously loaded)

# load Seer insitu stuff as follows 
spack load -r mochi-margo
spack load -r mochi-sdskv+leveldb
# or
source evn/env_darwin_new.sh


# Run the sim

# Distributed memory
# mpirun -np 4 <sim_name> --insitu <input file>
mpirun -np 4 demoApps/miniAppStructured --insitu ../inputs/input-test.json  

# Shared memory (testing purposes only)
demoApps/testMPI na+sm://9923/0 1 foo 10  
~~~

<strong>Note:</strong> Steps The Mochi Server and the Sim can be on the same node


### 3. Run the client

#### Remote (On Server)

~~~bash
# Load the modules
spack load -r py-mochi-sdskv

~~~

#### Local (client)

~~~bash
# Tunnel to the server
#   ssh -N -f -L <port_number>:<host_name>:<port_number> username@cluster 
ssh -N -f -L 8897:cn30:8897 pascalgrosset@darwin-fe
~~~

In the browser:

~~~bash
# http://localhost:<port_number>
http://localhost:8897
~~~





# Note

## Environment setup

Scripts for setting up the environment different platforms are located in the evn folder:

* <machine_name>_sim.sh
* <machine_name>_mochiServer.sh
* <machine_name>_jupyter.sh

Scripts for launching sims are located in the script folder:

* miniAppStruc_darwin.sh
* runBatch__256_16_16_scaling_mochi.sh
* runBatch__64_8_8_glaton_mochi.sh


## No papi counters found

* Check if papi events are around using: papi_avail | more
* Turn them on (if disabled) using: sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
